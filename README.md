# Quote Generator

A Python program that displays quotes by category, including sources and extra information. Features include:

- Show a random quote by category  
- List all available categories  
- Print all quotes  
- Hidden sorting option  
- 3-second pause for readability between quotes  

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
````

## Custom Quotes

If you want to create your own `quotes.txt` file, format each quote as:

```
category|text|source|extra
```

Each line represents a single quote, with the category, text, source, and optional extra info separated by a pipe (`|`).

## About This Project

I made this project as a way to revisit quotes I’ve saved over the years. Recently, I found an old document full of interesting quotes, and I thought it would be nice to turn it into a Python program for easy browsing.
